## Detailed Screenshots & Instructions

### Finding Email Templates in Supabase

**Path:**
```
Supabase Dashboard
  → Authentication (left sidebar)
    → Email Templates
      → "Confirm signup" template
```

**What you'll see:**
- A text editor with HTML code
- Current email template displayed
- Preview panel (maybe on right)
- Update/Save button at bottom

### HTML Code Location

In `supabase/README.md`:

```
Line 50: ### 5. Configure Custom Email Templates
Line 55: #### Confirm Signup Email

[Instructions here...]

Line ~65: ```html
         <!DOCTYPE html>
         <html>
         ...
         </html>
         ```html
```

The HTML starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and ends with `</html>`.

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Template is empty"
- Make sure you selected and copied the ENTIRE HTML block
- Check you didn't cut off the `</html>` tag
- Try again with fresh copy

### "Email still looks old"
- Supabase might cache for 5 minutes
- Try sending another test email
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Refresh page and resend test

### "Name shows as [object Object]"
- This won't happen - Supabase handles the variable `{{ user_metadata.name }}`
- If it does, verify you copied the template completely
- Update template and resend test

### "Button link doesn't work"
- The `{{ confirmation_link }}` variable is Supabase auto-filled
- Links only work in actual sent emails (not test preview)
- Test by creating new account and checking real email

### "Styling looks broken"
- Some email clients strip CSS
- This is normal - template still works
- Verify in Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail
- Design degrades gracefully without CSS

## Template Features Explained

### Personalization

Hi <span class="greeting-name">{{ user_metadata.name || 'there' }}</span>! 👋
```
- Uses `{{ user_metadata.name }}` from user profile
- Falls back to "there" if no name provided
- Shows actual user's name in every email

### Confirmation Link
```html
<a href="{{ confirmation_link }}" class="cta-button">
    Verify Email Now
</a>
```
- `{{ confirmation_link }}` auto-generated by Supabase
- Unique for each user
- Valid for 24 hours
- Redirects to your app after verification

### Color Scheme
All colors in template match Cybersec-Arena brand:
- **Primary**: `#8B5CF6` (purple)
- **Light**: `#A78BFA` (light purple)
- **Dark**: `#764ba2` (dark purple)

You can customize colors by finding these hex codes in the CSS and replacing them.

1. **Check template HTML** - Verify it's complete and not cut off
2. **Verify variables** - Should see `{{ }}` template variables
3. **Test in different email clients** - Some strip CSS
